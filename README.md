# Simple API

## Reasons for creating a simple API
- I want to expand my programming knowledge and heard that creating a API is a exciting way to do that
- A API is a handy tool that once I understand it, **CAN** have many uses

## Things I want this API to do
1. I have no idea
2. I might figure it out.

In conclusion, I just wanted to mess around with github some more, and creating a API. Now I also kinda understand .md files and how to create them. Which is also pretty handy.
